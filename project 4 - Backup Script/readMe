Sure, I'd be happy to explain each line of the Backup Script project.


#!/bin/bash
This line is called the shebang line, and it specifies the path to the Bash interpreter 
that will execute the script. In this case, we're using #!/bin/bash, which is the path 
to the Bash interpreter.


current_date=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
This line uses the date command to get the current date and time, and stores it in the 
current_date variable. The date format used here is %Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S, which specifies 
the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second separated by underscores.


echo "Enter the directory to back up:"
read backup_directory
These lines prompt the user to enter the directory to back up, and read the input into the 
backup_directory variable.


if [ ! -d "$backup_directory" ]; then
    echo "Error: Directory does not exist."
    exit 1
fi
This if statement checks if the specified directory exists. If the directory does not exist, 
the script displays an error message and exits with a status code of 1.


tar -czf "${backup_directory}_${current_date}.tar.gz" "$backup_directory"
This line creates a compressed tarball of the specified directory's contents using the tar command. 
The -c option specifies that we want to create an archive, the -z option specifies that we want to 
compress the archive using gzip, and the -f option specifies the filename for the archive. We use 
the value of the backup_directory and current_date variables to form the filename of the tarball.


I hope this helps you understand each line of the Backup Script project!
