Let's go through each line of the script and explain what it does:


#!/bin/bash
This is the shebang line, which specifies the path to the Bash interpreter that will execute the script.

echo "Enter a number:"
read number
These lines prompt the user to enter a number and read the input into the number variable.


factorial=1
This line initializes the factorial variable to 1. We will use this variable to store the result of the factorial calculation.

if [ $number -lt 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer."
    exit 1
fi
This if statement checks if the input number is less than 0. If the number is less than 0, the script displays an error 
message and exits with a status code of 1.


if [ $number -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "The factorial of 0 is 1."
    exit 0
fi
This if statement checks if the input number is equal to 0. If the number is equal to 0, the script displays a message 
that the factorial of 0 is 1 and exits with a status code of 0.


for (( i=1; i<=$number; i++ )); do
    factorial=$((factorial*i))
done
This for loop calculates the factorial of the input number. The loop starts at 1 and goes up to the input number, 
multiplying each iteration's value by the previous factorial value.


echo "The factorial of $number is $factorial."
This line displays the result of the factorial calculation.

I hope this helps you understand the Project 5 script!
